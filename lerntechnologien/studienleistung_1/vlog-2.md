# Vlog Entry 2 - 05-10-20

This is the second entry of a series of 'vlog' entries for 'Lerntechnologien'.

## Reflection

### What

- "Grundlagen des Lernens - Didaktisches Handeln" 
- 'Main' educational learning theories:
    - Behaviorism (Conditioning, positive/negative reinforcement) 
        - -> *unidirectional*

    - Cognitivism (Brain I/O, Transmitting/Receiving) 
        - -> *bidirectional*

    - Constructivism (My world != your world) 
        - -> *bidirectional*

    - Learning is an autopoietic process

- ... and then the distractions kicked in!

### How

- Reading
- Researching unknown terms
- Classifying

### Motivation

- Introduction to educational learning theories

### Distraction

- My arch nemesis of filetypes, the **PDF**
- Too many ideas how to 'improve' studying
- Small tasks can quickly turn into big ..
- ... but it is so much fun :)

### Conclusion (Thank you, Stephanie)

- Reflecting works !!
